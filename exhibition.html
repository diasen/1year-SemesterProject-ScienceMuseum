            <h2>Evolution</h2>
            <p>
              For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
              question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get
              here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
              framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we
              know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to
              meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our
              Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

            <p>
              From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in
              biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of
              the tiny world. For many people their life expectancy is much
              longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the
              growth of our understanding of medicine.

              Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and
              take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of
              penicillin and the first heart transplant.

              As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the
              planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how
              to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the
              whole planet.

              In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we

              and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all
              contribute to a brighter future.

            <p>
              On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica
              exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It’s a
              series of installations that allow visitors to experience the
              power of the elements as we harness them. From solar energy
              powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are
              able to use and control wind to create power.
